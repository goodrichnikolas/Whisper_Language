00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,0
 Hey, Flanders, when are your busy hours?

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 Oh, I expect things to start picking up soon.

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
 I think word of mouth is starting to spread.

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
 Hey, I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase.

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:16,0
 Oh, right is rain. Or as we say around here, left is rain.

6
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:17,0
 Just stamp the ticket.

7
00:00:17,0 --> 00:00:19,0
 Oh, okay.

8
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:25,0
 Hello, Governor. Lube job while you white?

9
00:00:25,0 --> 00:00:27,0
 Don't touch me.

10
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:30,0
 20% off at Lullabies.

11
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:32,0
 This tall and big baby sent you.

12
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:35,0
 I know you can hear me. I'm talking to you.

13
00:00:35,0 --> 00:00:37,0
 You sicken me.

14
00:00:37,0 --> 00:00:43,0
 Your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really cool.

15
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:45,0
 I doubt my son or daughter is that stupid.

16
00:00:45,0 --> 00:00:47,0
 No.

17
00:00:51,0 --> 00:00:53,0
 I need one 29-cent stamp.

18
00:00:53,0 --> 00:00:55,0
 That's $1.85.

19
00:00:55,0 --> 00:00:57,0
 I want $2 worth of gas, please.

20
00:00:57,0 --> 00:00:59,0
 How much is your petty candy?

21
00:00:59,0 --> 00:01:01,0
 Surprisingly expensive.

22
00:01:01,0 --> 00:01:03,0
 What a ripoff.

23
00:01:03,0 --> 00:01:05,0
 This is what I think of your store.

24
00:01:05,0 --> 00:01:09,0
 You're a jerk.

25
00:01:21,0 --> 00:01:25,0
 I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work.

26
00:01:25,0 --> 00:01:28,0
 With the money you would have made working, you could have bought tickets from a scalper.

27
00:01:28,0 --> 00:01:30,0
 In theory, yes. Jerk.

28
00:01:30,0 --> 00:01:35,0
 The shine on my shoulders makes me happy.

29
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:41,0
 Sir, hello, sir.

30
00:01:41,0 --> 00:01:45,0
 Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife.

31
00:01:51,0 --> 00:01:53,0
 Who controls the British crown?

32
00:01:53,0 --> 00:01:55,0
 Who keeps the metric system down?

33
00:01:55,0 --> 00:01:57,0
 We do.

34
00:01:57,0 --> 00:01:59,0
 We do.

35
00:01:59,0 --> 00:02:01,0
 Who links Atlantis off the maps?

36
00:02:01,0 --> 00:02:03,0
 Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

37
00:02:03,0 --> 00:02:05,0
 We do.

38
00:02:05,0 --> 00:02:07,0
 We do.

39
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:11,0
 Who holds back the electric car?

40
00:02:11,0 --> 00:02:15,0
 Who makes the Gutenberg a sark?

41
00:02:15,0 --> 00:02:17,0
 We do.

42
00:02:17,0 --> 00:02:19,0
 We do.

43
00:02:19,0 --> 00:02:22,0
 Who robscape fish of their sight?

44
00:02:22,0 --> 00:02:24,0
 Who rigs every Oscar night?

45
00:02:24,0 --> 00:02:26,0
 We do.

46
00:02:26,0 --> 00:02:28,0
 We do.

47
00:02:28,0 --> 00:02:30,0
 We do.

48
00:02:32,0 --> 00:02:34,0
 Thank you.

49
00:02:34,0 --> 00:02:42,0
 And as a final humiliation, you must walk home naked, dragging behind you the stone of shame.

50
00:02:51,0 --> 00:02:53,0
 The mark.

51
00:02:53,0 --> 00:02:57,0
 Oh, there. It's just a birthmark, and I'll thank you not to stare.

52
00:02:57,0 --> 00:03:00,0
 He's the chosen one.

53
00:03:02,0 --> 00:03:09,0
 You are the chosen one, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory.

54
00:03:09,0 --> 00:03:16,0
 Now, to the top of Mount Springfield for the coronation, remove the stone of shame.

55
00:03:16,0 --> 00:03:17,0
 Woohoo!

56
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:20,0
 Attach the stone of triumph.

57
00:03:20,0 --> 00:03:22,0
 Oh!

58
00:03:22,0 --> 00:03:24,0
 Yay!

59
00:03:29,0 --> 00:03:31,0
 Here, let me gift wrap that for you.

60
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:33,0
 Mind if I tidy you up a bit while you wait?

61
00:03:33,0 --> 00:03:36,0
 Help yourself to a piece of candy from that bowl.

62
00:03:36,0 --> 00:03:37,0
 I'll just comb your hair.

63
00:03:37,0 --> 00:03:38,0
 Stop it, stop it.

64
00:03:38,0 --> 00:03:42,0
 Cancel my purchase. I'll just learn to be right-handed.

65
00:03:42,0 --> 00:03:45,0
 Sorry, I drove him away.

66
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:51,0
 No, it was me. I don't give anyone a moment's peace. I'm a monster.

67
00:03:51,0 --> 00:03:56,0
 Why don't we start out with some questions from the audience? Yes, yes, you, sir.

68
00:03:56,0 --> 00:03:59,0
 Yeah, why does this show feel like it's 20 years out of date?

69
00:03:59,0 --> 00:04:04,0
 Because...wait, could you repeat that?

70
00:04:04,0 --> 00:04:22,0
 Yes, I said I love the show and so does my family. And camera three.

71
00:04:22,0 --> 00:04:29,0
 Come back, come back! Willie still loves you, oh great one!

72
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:32,0
 Just fill out this form and you're on your way to the reserve.

73
00:04:32,0 --> 00:04:34,0
 There's a question that's crossed out.

74
00:04:34,0 --> 00:04:38,0
 Well, due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to ask that particular question.

75
00:04:38,0 --> 00:04:41,0
 Well I think I can make it out. Are you a homosexual...

76
00:04:41,0 --> 00:04:44,0
 For God's sake, don't answer that. I could go to jail.

77
00:04:44,0 --> 00:04:46,0
 But I'm not a homosexual...

78
00:04:46,0 --> 00:04:49,0
 La la la la la, I am not listening, la la la la la la la la la la.

79
00:04:49,0 --> 00:04:54,0
 Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay.

80
00:04:54,0 --> 00:04:58,0
 Hey everybody look! Herman Tim's area is back!

81
00:04:58,0 --> 00:05:13,0
 You idiots! She meant we should disperse!
