00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,740
Good evening. Good evening. I have your attention. Yes. Thank you. Good evening. As always, we

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,320
are really grateful for those of you who pitch in here and add your ideas.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,480
Except you never use any of our ideas or really listen.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,240
Jay, I don't think you can say that and be fair. Look, I am more than happy to look at

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,240
your ideas. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Chris is here to talk about some ways we are

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,240
trying to include more physical activity in the curriculum to deal with this fatigue problem.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:48,200
I'm sorry. What was that? Sorry? Oh, it's my first PTA meeting. Oh, well, thank you.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,040
Thank you for coming. Thanks. I just was wondering what is meant by the fatigue problem? Yeah,

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm curious about that, too. It's also my first PTA meeting. I work high.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,000
The fatigue problem is what was identified in the first quarter of the school year as

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,240
being a marked decline in the spirit and interest and energy of the kids here, usually around

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,520
noon or right after lunch. It's because of the lunch. They aren't given

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,240
enough time to eat. No, it's not that. They're being demoralized.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
You fill them with academics. You don't tell them who they are.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,080
For now, we are focusing on the lack of physical activity. Now, we still don't have a gym because

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,120
of last year's diarrhea flood. Excuse me. Excuse me. My name is Nancy Cartesian.

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,520
My son is never Cartesian. Jesus.

18
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,760
He has definitely suffered from the fatigue syndrome. In my opinion, it's because of the

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,920
competitive nature of the school, of the children. I'm reading about this Reggio teaching method

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,360
from Italy. It's like Montessori, only it's a little bit more creative.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,520
When are they supposed to dance? It's the academics. This place is still stuck

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,760
in the 70s. Who still teaches math anymore? We've been talking about introducing some

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,560
competitive sports. I think our kids just need to be allowed to

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,440
play more creatively. You are all way off. This problem is...

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,720
It's school, right? I mean, school sucks, right?

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,800
You do what you can to improve it, but in the end, there's a limit because it's school.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:39,840
School sucks. Remember?

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:03:01,280
Hey. Hey. Hey, can I get one of those?

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,800
Sure. Thank you.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:13,080
Yeah, I don't think your school sucks initiative is going to get much support, I'm just saying.

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:34,120
I know.
