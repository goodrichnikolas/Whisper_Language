00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,440
Because of the vote, Omni is going to put up a hotel with a Galleria on the first floor.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,760
Word came down yesterday.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,600
A Galleria?

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,760
Fifty stores selling sneakers and turnip greens?

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,760
It's a demographic imperative.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,260
Hoboken's maxed out.

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,360
The Prada people are already moving to Down Neck.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,320
Where are they going to go next?

You know, my old man, he had a piece of the garbage transfer station in Lower Manhattan

back in the 70s.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,240
That people told him.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,480
Stopped buying up the abandoned buildings around here, but he couldn't see it.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
And now it's Tribeca.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,280
I tell you, Tony, I'm borrowing money myself to grab up parcels along Freeling-Hisen Avenue

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
through a shell company.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,800
And a private citizen like you, who's going to quibble with patriotic entrepreneurism?

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:27,800
My uncle has property down on Freeling-Hisen.
