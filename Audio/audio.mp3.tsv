0	12740	Good evening. Good evening. I have your attention. Yes. Thank you. Good evening. As always, we
12740	17320	are really grateful for those of you who pitch in here and add your ideas.
17320	21480	Except you never use any of our ideas or really listen.
21480	28240	Jay, I don't think you can say that and be fair. Look, I am more than happy to look at
28240	34240	your ideas. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Chris is here to talk about some ways we are
34240	40240	trying to include more physical activity in the curriculum to deal with this fatigue problem.
40240	48200	I'm sorry. What was that? Sorry? Oh, it's my first PTA meeting. Oh, well, thank you.
48200	53040	Thank you for coming. Thanks. I just was wondering what is meant by the fatigue problem? Yeah,
53040	61360	I'm curious about that, too. It's also my first PTA meeting. I work high.
61360	66000	The fatigue problem is what was identified in the first quarter of the school year as
66000	72240	being a marked decline in the spirit and interest and energy of the kids here, usually around
72240	76520	noon or right after lunch. It's because of the lunch. They aren't given
76520	80240	enough time to eat. No, it's not that. They're being demoralized.
80240	84240	You fill them with academics. You don't tell them who they are.
84240	90080	For now, we are focusing on the lack of physical activity. Now, we still don't have a gym because
90080	96120	of last year's diarrhea flood. Excuse me. Excuse me. My name is Nancy Cartesian.
96120	100520	My son is never Cartesian. Jesus.
100520	105760	He has definitely suffered from the fatigue syndrome. In my opinion, it's because of the
105760	110920	competitive nature of the school, of the children. I'm reading about this Reggio teaching method
110920	114360	from Italy. It's like Montessori, only it's a little bit more creative.
114360	118520	When are they supposed to dance? It's the academics. This place is still stuck
118520	122760	in the 70s. Who still teaches math anymore? We've been talking about introducing some
122760	125560	competitive sports. I think our kids just need to be allowed to
125560	129440	play more creatively. You are all way off. This problem is...
129440	136720	It's school, right? I mean, school sucks, right?
136720	144800	You do what you can to improve it, but in the end, there's a limit because it's school.
144800	159840	School sucks. Remember?
159840	181280	Hey. Hey. Hey, can I get one of those?
181280	183800	Sure. Thank you.
183800	193080	Yeah, I don't think your school sucks initiative is going to get much support, I'm just saying.
193080	214120	I know.
