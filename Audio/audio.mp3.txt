Good news about the Esplanade, the legislature has voted to refund the special Newark Development
District along Freeling-Hisen Avenue north from the Museum of Trucking.
Because of the vote, Omni is going to put up a hotel with a Galleria on the first floor.
Word came down yesterday.
A Galleria?
Fifty stores selling sneakers and turnip greens?
It's a demographic imperative.
Hoboken's maxed out.
The Prada people are already moving to Down Neck.
Where are they going to go next?

back in the 70s.

And now it's Tribeca.

through a shell company.

My uncle has property down on Freeling-Hisen.
