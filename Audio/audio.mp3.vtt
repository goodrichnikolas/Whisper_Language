Good evening. Good evening. I have your attention. Yes. Thank you. Good evening. As always, we

00:12.740 --> 00:17.320
are really grateful for those of you who pitch in here and add your ideas.

00:17.320 --> 00:21.480
Except you never use any of our ideas or really listen.

00:21.480 --> 00:28.240
Jay, I don't think you can say that and be fair. Look, I am more than happy to look at

00:28.240 --> 00:34.240
your ideas. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Chris is here to talk about some ways we are

00:34.240 --> 00:40.240
trying to include more physical activity in the curriculum to deal with this fatigue problem.

00:40.240 --> 00:48.200
I'm sorry. What was that? Sorry? Oh, it's my first PTA meeting. Oh, well, thank you.

00:48.200 --> 00:53.040
Thank you for coming. Thanks. I just was wondering what is meant by the fatigue problem? Yeah,

00:53.040 --> 01:01.360
I'm curious about that, too. It's also my first PTA meeting. I work high.

01:01.360 --> 01:06.000
The fatigue problem is what was identified in the first quarter of the school year as

01:06.000 --> 01:12.240
being a marked decline in the spirit and interest and energy of the kids here, usually around

01:12.240 --> 01:16.520
noon or right after lunch. It's because of the lunch. They aren't given

01:16.520 --> 01:20.240
enough time to eat. No, it's not that. They're being demoralized.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.240
You fill them with academics. You don't tell them who they are.

01:24.240 --> 01:30.080
For now, we are focusing on the lack of physical activity. Now, we still don't have a gym because

01:30.080 --> 01:36.120
of last year's diarrhea flood. Excuse me. Excuse me. My name is Nancy Cartesian.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.520
My son is never Cartesian. Jesus.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.760
He has definitely suffered from the fatigue syndrome. In my opinion, it's because of the

01:45.760 --> 01:50.920
competitive nature of the school, of the children. I'm reading about this Reggio teaching method

01:50.920 --> 01:54.360
from Italy. It's like Montessori, only it's a little bit more creative.

01:54.360 --> 01:58.520
When are they supposed to dance? It's the academics. This place is still stuck

01:58.520 --> 02:02.760
in the 70s. Who still teaches math anymore? We've been talking about introducing some

02:02.760 --> 02:05.560
competitive sports. I think our kids just need to be allowed to

02:05.560 --> 02:09.440
play more creatively. You are all way off. This problem is...

02:09.440 --> 02:16.720
It's school, right? I mean, school sucks, right?

02:16.720 --> 02:24.800
You do what you can to improve it, but in the end, there's a limit because it's school.

02:24.800 --> 02:39.840
School sucks. Remember?

02:39.840 --> 03:01.280
Hey. Hey. Hey, can I get one of those?

03:01.280 --> 03:03.800
Sure. Thank you.

03:03.800 --> 03:13.080
Yeah, I don't think your school sucks initiative is going to get much support, I'm just saying.

03:13.080 --> 03:34.120
I know.
