District along Freeling-Hisen Avenue north from the Museum of Trucking.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.440
Because of the vote, Omni is going to put up a hotel with a Galleria on the first floor.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.760
Word came down yesterday.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.600
A Galleria?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.760
Fifty stores selling sneakers and turnip greens?

00:24.760 --> 00:26.760
It's a demographic imperative.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.260
Hoboken's maxed out.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.360

You know, my old man, he had a piece of the garbage transfer station in Lower Manhattan

00:45.480 --> 00:51.280
I tell you, Tony, I'm borrowing money myself to grab up parcels along Freeling-Hisen Avenue

00:51.280 --> 00:52.280
through a shell company.

00:52.280 --> 00:59.800

00:59.800 --> 01:27.800
My uncle has property down on Freeling-Hisen.
